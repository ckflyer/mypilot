"""Step 5: the regression pass, as a matrix rather than a checklist.

WHY THIS IS A SUITE AND NOT AN AFTERNOON. The roadmap called step 5 "a
regression pass across themes, time formats and the odd states", which
describes a person clicking through the app once. That finds today's
breakage and nothing after it. The same combinations run on every commit
find it forever, and they cost seconds.

The 1.18.0 Import bug is the argument. Both halves of that path were
tested and the JOIN was not, so a dead button survived nine releases.
Everything here is a join: a PAGE, rendered under a STATE, for a ROLE,
in a THEME, at a CLOCK. Nothing in this file asserts on wording or
layout — the other suites do that, and duplicating it here would make
every copy-edit break a regression test. This asks a narrower question:
does the page come out whole, and does it come out in the shape the
settings asked for.

WHAT COUNTS AS BROKEN HERE
  * any status that is not 200 (or an expected redirect)
  * an unrendered Jinja expression reaching the browser
  * the literal "None" printed where a value should be
  * a page that ignores the theme or clock it was handed
  * a traceback

The odd states are the ones that have actually broken this app before,
which is why they are these and not a general-purpose fuzz: an empty
roster (a brand-new account), a roster of nothing but past legs (the
window that 1.16.0's handover exists for), a single leg with no trip
around it, a cancelled leg, a deadhead, and an airport the coordinate
database does not know.
