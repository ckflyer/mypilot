"""Airplanes.live ADS-B provider.

Docs: https://airplanes.live/api-guide/
Fields: https://airplanes.live/rest-api-adsb-data-field-descriptions/

No API key, no OAuth, no account. Queries one callsign directly
(GET /v2/callsign/ENY3729) rather than pulling every aircraft on earth and
filtering locally, which is what the old OpenSky client had to do.

This module's ONLY job is to turn one provider's JSON into the normalized
state dict defined in livesource.py. It does no caching, no rate limiting,
and knows nothing about flights, legs, or users — so swapping providers
means writing one more module with a `fetch_state()` of the same shape and
changing a single import in livesource.py. Nothing downstream can tell
which service the data came from.

Rate limiting and caching live in livesource.py, deliberately, so they
apply no matter which provider is plugged in.

# WHY THERE IS A LIST HERE RATHER THAN ONE URL.
#
# airplanes.live closed its public API. The endpoint still answers, but with
# HTTP 403 and a message asking you to email them for access — so every
# lookup silently returned None and no aircraft was ever tracked, while the
# schedule and AeroAPI carried on working normally. Nothing in this app was
# broken; the door was shut from the other side.
#
# Several other feeds expose the SAME response shape, because they all run
# the same underlying tar1090/re-api software. That means one parser serves
# all of them and switching is a matter of which host answers, not new code.
# Enabled feeds are tried in order and the first that works is remembered.
#
# The list lives in the database so it can be edited from the diagnostics
# page without a redeploy — the whole point being that when a feed shuts
# down, the fix is choosing a different line, not shipping code.
