"""Four tables. Two of them are large; two are tiny.

    users       — accounts, preferences, AeroAPI key and spend counters
    flights     — ONE ROW PER REAL-WORLD FLIGHT, SHARED BY ALL CREW.
                  Every fact about it, in a named column, whether it came
                  from ADS-B or the airline. NOT scoped to a user.
    roster      — which flights are on whose schedule. Per-user: position
                  in the list, deadhead or working, trip boundary.
    positions   — the breadcrumb trail, keyed by flight

WHY `flights` IS SHARED (v5.1)
------------------------------
Crew fly together. When a captain and an FO are both using this app on the
same leg, that is ONE aeroplane, ONE takeoff, ONE gate-in. v5.0 gave them a
row each and wrote observed facts to both, which worked but meant two
AeroAPI queries for one flight — each pilot's key paying separately for an
identical answer. One row means one query serves everyone, and the two
views cannot drift apart.

The split is: anything true of the AEROPLANE lives on `flights`; anything
true of a PERSON'S RELATIONSHIP to it lives on `roster`. Deadheading is the
clearest case — the same flight is a working leg for one pilot and a
deadhead for another, so `is_deadhead` is a roster fact, not a flight fact.

Before v5.0 this was seven tables. A single leg's story was spread across
`legs` (the schedule), `flight_aircraft` (what ADS-B had seen),
`flight_enrichment` (a JSON blob of what the airline said) and
`flight_closeout` (another JSON blob). Nothing owned the flight, so four
modules each reached into their own table and `compute_live_payload`
reconciled the pieces at DISPLAY time, on every page render, for every
viewer. That reconciliation is where the ordering bugs lived.

Now the poller decides once and writes it down; everything else reads the
row. Two more tables, `aircraft` and `positions` (the old user-scoped
one), were dead — nothing had read or written them in several versions.

WHY ADS-B AND AIRLINE VALUES SIT IN SEPARATE COLUMNS
-----------------------------------------------------
`off_actual_api` and `off_observed` are both "when the wheels came off".
Keeping them apart means the card can say WHICH it's showing, the two can
be compared when they disagree, and a lagging airline record can never
silently overwrite something we watched happen. Merging them into one
column would throw away the disagreement, which is the interesting part.

MIGRATION
---------
`users` and the schedule carry over. Breadcrumb tracks carry over. The old
enrichment and closeout blobs do NOT — they were 30-day data in a shape
that no longer exists, and parsing them into columns would be a one-off
guess at fields we can simply re-fetch. Past flights keep their route and
their flown path; their gate times start over.
