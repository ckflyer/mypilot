    A trip begins at a leg carrying `trip_start`, which the parser sets

    such leg is its own trip, so a roster with NO markers at all comes
    back as one trip containing everything — which degrades to exactly the
    old behaviour rather than to an empty tracker.

    A BLANK LINE IS A HINT, NOT A VERDICT (1.26.1).
    -----------------------------------------------
    The blank-line rule assumed pilots separate TRIPS with blank lines.
    Plenty separate DAYS with them, which is just as natural a way to
    paste a roster and which the app never pushed back on. The result was
    silent and bad: a three-day trip became three trips, the tracker
    window is one trip, and so every leg already flown vanished from the
    page the moment the calendar rolled over. From outside it read as
    "past flights aren't showing" with no clue that a blank line caused
    it.

    So a marker only splits a trip when the CLOCK agrees with it. The gap
    between the last arrival and the next departure has to be at least
    GAP_TRIP_THRESHOLD_HOURS — the same 35 hours already used to suggest
    boundaries on the import review page, so the two cannot disagree
    about what a trip is. An overnight layover is nowhere near 35 hours;
    a genuine gap between trips comfortably clears it.

    A marker whose legs have no usable times still splits. Unknown is not
    evidence against the pilot's own paste, and honouring it there keeps
    this a narrowing of the rule rather than a replacement for it.

    Scope: this function feeds tracker_window and nothing else. Day
    grouping, overnight labels and the calendar all read `trip_start`
    directly and are deliberately untouched — a blank line still means
    what it always meant everywhere it is displayed.

         This is the whole reason the rule exists. Without it the trip
