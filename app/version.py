"""The four version numbers this app carries, and why they are four.

They get confused constantly, so each one is named for the question it
answers. If you are adding a fifth, you are probably conflating two of these.

    VERSION             which BUILD is running          1.0.0
    API_VERSION         what SHAPE the JSON is          1
    SCHEMA_VERSION      what SHAPE the DATABASE is      1
    MIN_CLIENT_VERSION  oldest BUILD still supported    1.0.0

They move independently. A week of UI work bumps VERSION three times and
touches none of the others.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
WHY THE OLD SCHEME WAS REPLACED (v7.4 -> 1.0.0)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Versions used to be a single decimal: 5.5, 6.3, 7.4. Two problems, one fatal.

The fatal one: 7.9 is followed by 7.10, and "7.10" sorts BEFORE "7.9" in
every string comparison and equals 7.1 in every numeric one. Anything that
ever compares versions -- an update prompt, a migration guard, a minimum
client check -- silently reads the newer build as older. There is no way to
patch around this after the fact; the numbers themselves are ambiguous.

The lesser one: a single number cannot say how big a change is. "6.3 -> 6.4"
gave no hint whether that was a colour tweak or a database rebuild, which is
exactly what a person deciding whether to back up first needs to know.

So: semantic versioning, MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, restarting at 1.0.0 with the
MyPilot rebrand. 1.0.0 rather than 0.1.0 because the thing is already flying
real trips for real families with 400 tests behind it -- calling that a
pre-release would be false modesty that misleads anyone reading the number.

    MAJOR  a break. Data migrates one way and cannot migrate back, or an
           old client stops working. Back up before deploying one.
    MINOR  a new capability, nothing existing breaks. The common case.
    PATCH  a fix. No new behaviour, no new data.

Ordering rule: compare field by field as INTEGERS, never as text and never
as a float. 1.10.0 is newer than 1.9.0. Use version_tuple() below; do not
hand-roll the comparison at the call site.

# Bump ONLY on a break: a removed field, a renamed field, a changed type.

# SERVING THE OLD SHAPE until nothing calls it, because an installed app on
# someone's phone cannot be updated from here.

# Migrations are append-only and idempotent (see db.py). This number exists

#
# Exposed at /api/v1/meta so a client can check itself on launch and say
# "please update" rather than rendering a blank screen against a contract it
# no longer understands. Raise it only when an old build genuinely cannot
# work -- it force-updates people, and doing that casually trains them to
# dread the app.
