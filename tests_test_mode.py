"""Test mode, and who is allowed to run it. (1.6.0)

Two features, one suite, because they are the same claim from two sides:
this install can be OPERATED — rehearsed, inspected, handed to a second
administrator — without SSH, without SQL, and without money.

THE THING THIS SUITE MOSTLY GUARDS is that a rehearsal cannot touch
anything real. Test mode invents flights, and an invention that leaks is
worse than no test mode at all: a simulated leg that spent an AeroAPI
credit costs money for a flight that does not exist, and one that reached
a logbook would put a fiction in a legal record. So the isolation tests
outnumber the "does it work" tests on purpose.

The other half is that the simulator must NOT fake the app's answers. It
produces position reports and nothing else; `flightmatch`, `tags` and
`closure` then run on them unchanged. A simulator that wrote `closed = 1`
directly would prove nothing at all, so several tests here assert that the
closure REASON is the real production route.

# These pinned `.diag { overflow-wrap: anywhere; }`, `table-layout: fixed`
# and `min-width: 0 !important` — three rules that existed to stop a
# four-column TABLE of inline-styled inputs from pushing the admin page
# sideways on a phone. The table is gone: the feeds editor is stacked
# blocks now, because a table that CAN overflow will always choose to
# overflow before it wraps, and `!important` on a generated input was a
# cover for that rather than a fix.
#
# So the assertion is the rule itself. Long unbreakable tokens (a
# 180-character raw API error, a feed URL) must break, and nothing in
# the panel may carry a fixed minimum width that a phone cannot honour.
