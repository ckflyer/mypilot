four styles x five sizes x two treatments. Editing those by hand guarantees
they drift apart. Change a path here and re-run; everything regenerates

The same paths are also emitted into static/planes.js so the MAP MARKER and

# SINGLE PATH. "Modern" used to be three overlapping shapes — fuselage,
# wing, tailplane — plus two nacelle rects. That is fine filled flat on a
# tile, and it is a mess on the map: the marker strokes a dark outline
# round EVERY shape, so you saw outlines crossing through the middle of the
# aeroplane and the whole thing read as a smudge. One closed path strokes
# once, on its own edge, which is what a marker needs.
#
# NO SEPARATE MARKER BODY. Each style used to carry a second, simplified
# `marker` path so the outline survived at 40px. A single path survives
# fine, and having two meant the map and the home screen were drawing
# genuinely different aeroplanes.
#
# All drawn nose-up in a 64 viewBox so they are interchangeable.

#
# That matters because the map marker rotates about the viewBox centre and is
# pinned to the aircraft's position by that same point. If the shape's centre
# and the viewBox centre are different points, the plane is drawn beside its
# own coordinates, and the error grows with the heading.
#
# Measured here rather than typed in below, because a hand-entered number is
# a number that goes stale the first time somebody nudges a path and doesn't
# think to re-measure. Deliberately dependency-free: this script already
# needs Pillow, and adding an SVG library to compute four pairs of floats
# would be a poor trade.
