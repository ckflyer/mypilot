"""The v1.0.0 surface: install shell, versioning, schema guard, rebrand.

Every check here exists because the thing it guards fails SILENTLY. That is
the common thread and the reason this suite is worth its runtime:

  * A missing manifest link does not error. The page renders perfectly and
    "Add to Home Screen" quietly produces a bookmark with no icon. Through
    v7.4 this was the state of EIGHT of ten templates, including the login
    page — the first screen a family member ever sees.

  * A service worker whose cache name does not change on deploy does not
    error either. It serves the previous build's CSS and JavaScript forever,
    and the symptom is indistinguishable from "the server didn't update".

  * An old build opening a newer database does not error. It writes rows
    that drop the columns it does not know about, and the damage surfaces
    weeks later.

  * A carrier name left in a template does not error. It just ships.
